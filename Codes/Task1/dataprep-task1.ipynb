in the series',\n 'for the past couple of years horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the five nights at freddys series after another with four core games one rpg spinoff and a novel released so far the next game in the franchise five nights at freddys sister location was scheduled to release this coming friday october 7th but if developer scott cawthon is to be believed the project has been delayed by a few months',\n 'according to a post by cawthon on the five nights at freddys sister location steam page the game is being delayed because its too dark cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely into something kidfriendly',\n 'delays happen in the gaming industry all the time but its rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release five nights at freddys fans are confused and angry about this latest development as many were looking forward to playing the game on friday something else upsetting fans is cawthons reasoning that the game is too dark to release as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game',\n 'cawthons reason for suddenly delaying five nights at freddys sister location from its planned october 7th release date doesnt make much sense a more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didnt even release it alternatively perhaps cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues',\n 'fans should also consider the possibility that cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing five nights at freddys games early and it wouldnt be all that shocking for five nights at freddys sister location to carry on that tradition despite cawthons post to the contrary',\n 'with october 7th just a few days away fans will learn soon enough whether or not cawthon is serious about sister locations delay if the game is delayed it will be interesting to see if cawthon actually does rework it to be more kidfriendly or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision',\n 'five nights at freddys sister location is scheduled to launch on october 7th for pc as well as ios and android mobile devices',\n 'source scott
